# My favourite projects from Ironhack #

*** If the project is not a rails app then simply cloning the repo and running the app in the console will be sufficient ***

*** Any Rails apps in this repo will have it's own specific README and the necessary instructions to follow. 

### Game of rooms ###

This exercise was a repeat of the earlier version we did in the bootcamp but this time written in Javascript.
It is a game that is played in the terminal and prompts the user for input based on rooms available to navigate around with different actions available to perform in different rooms.
I completed this exercise while pair programming with my colleague Unai Esteibar.
This was a particulary interesting exercise as I was completely new to JS and we also implemented single responsibility design pattern.
Rather than creating a game with depth and story we decided to focus more on writing good code with dependency injection where possible.

### RockFest ###

My first attempt at a Rails app.
This app allows users to upload concerts in different locations on any date. These concerts can then be accessed by viewers as a list of organised events. The home page showcases any events that are live today and on the sidebar you can see upcoming concerts.
I particularly enjoyed this project as it was my first opportunity to see the backend and frontend being linked together to produce a useable product.
I used bootstrap for the styling. Understanding Rails was very challenging at first.

### Shopping Cart ###

A very simple application that allows items to be added to a shopping cart and purchased.
This was my first JS challenge that I did on my own.
My main objective with this exercise was to try and utilise the open-close design pattern as well as single responsibility.

### Twitter ###

This exercise was to clone the Twitter homepage as closely as possible. I really enjoyed this particular exercise as it helped me understand how to structure, style and layout a web page.
